<h1><u>Large Numbers</u></h1>
<h2>Documantation:</h2>
<p>Here we will perform operations on large numbers with C programming.</p>
<pre> <h3>Declaration : </h3> 
  Since there is a limit to integer numbers, we will take the number as a string.<br>
  Then we will add the numbers that are strings as integers and print the result as a string again.<br>
  For example:<br>
  str="3434343535343534";
  str2="32324123";
  result="3434343567667657";</pre>
<h3>Arithmetic Operators: </h3>
<p>
    <pre>+ addition </pre>
    <pre>- subtraction </pre>
    <pre>* multiplication</pre>
</p>
<h3>Relational Operator: </h3>
<pre> <,<=,>,>=,==,!=</pre>
